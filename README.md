# Intercept CSS

Sample project to demonstrate how to intercept and change the application CSS with [Cypress](https://cypress.io).

## Pre-requirements

It is required to have git, Node.js and npm installed to clone and run this project.

> I used versions `2.34.1`, `v18.15.0`, and `9.5.0.` of git, Node.js and npm, respectively. I suggest you use the same or later LTS versions.

## Installation

After cloning the repository and accessig it, run `npm install` (or `npm i` for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests

Run `npm test` (or `npm t` for the short version) to run the tests in headless mode.

Or, run `npm run cy:open` to open the Cypress App and run the tests in interactive mode.

### Test results

After running the tests, you should have a result like the one below.
